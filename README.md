## About.

THis code challenge has three main tasks:

> * To calculate and determine, using user input, the amount of basic ingredients needed to prepare a specific number of cups of __Kenyan Chai__.

> * To estimate the fare for a boda boda ride.

> * To estimate the transaction fees for a transfer of mobile money.



The project was done using the __Javascript__ programming language.

The three tasks have been undertaken in three different folders each with a Javascript file containing the logic of the program.

The whole project is hosted on [GitHub.](https://github.com/Joseph-Hansel/code-challenge-1)

## Project Setup.

To run the program, follow the following steps:

> * Go to the live page using this link: [Live page](https://joseph-hansel.github.io/code-challenge-1/)

> * Enter valid values as per the prompts that appear.

> [!NOTE]
> Failure to enter a value is not an option that can terminate the program. (You have to answer all prompts.)

Just to be sure that the program is harmless, you want to cross-check by cloning this repository to your local machine. 
You can then open the project folder in your preferred code editor (like VS Code) or, for quick viewing, open the index.html file directly in your web browser.
